# camerafetch

Simple scripts to fetch remote images at random intervals, stored to local folders. Also a `create-timelapse` script that can stitch together the images to create a timelapse video.

Usage
`python3 main.py`

Usage (timelapse)
`python3 create-timelapse.py camera_images`    *camera_images* is the default folder name I use.
